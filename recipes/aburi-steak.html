    <h1><strong>Aburi Steak</strong></h1>
    <img src="./aburi-steak.jpg">
    <p>Aburi steak, also known as flame-seared steak, is a Japanese culinary technique where high-quality steak is partially grilled or seared using an open flame or blowtorch. The term "aburi" translates to "flame-seared" in Japanese. This method allows the outer layer of the steak to caramelize and develop a delicious crust, while the inside remains tender and juicy.</p>
    <p>Aburi steak is often served sliced, allowing diners to enjoy both the seared outer layer and the succulent interior. It is commonly accompanied by sauces like teriyaki, ponzu, or a savory soy-based glaze, adding depth and richness to the dish. The result is a tender, flavorful steak with a delightful contrast between the crispy, smoky exterior and the melt-in-your-mouth center.</p>
    <h1><strong>Ingredients</strong></h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 to 16 ounce) boneless rib eye steak</li>
        <li>1/2 cup short grain white rice</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup less-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon pure maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Asian-style chili paste (such as sambal oelek)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon lime zest</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons wasabi paste <strong>(NOT RECOMMENED IF YOU CAN'T EAT SPICY FOODS)</strong>, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons furikake seasoning or toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Put steak on a waxed paper-lined baking sheet. Freeze until just firm, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, for sushi rice, rinse rice under cold running water, rubbing grains together with your fingers. Combine rice and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low. Simmer, covered, until tender and sticky, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir together vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Stir into rice. Cover; let cool about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, thinly slice steak across the grain into 24 (1/4-inch-thick) slices. Transfer steak to a zip-top bag set in a shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Whisk together soy sauce, maple syrup, chili paste, and oil in a small bowl. Pour over steak in bag; seal bag. Chill at least 20 minutes or up to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>For sauce, whisk together sour cream, lime zest, lime juice, and wasabi paste.</li>
        <li>Shape rice with wet hands into 24 (1-tablespoon) oval-shaped portions. Drain steak; discard marinade. Put steak on a foil-lined baking sheet set on a wire rack. Char steak with a kitchen torch, turning once, until desired doneness, about 5 minutes for entire recipe. Put 1 steak piece on each rice portion. Sprinkle with furikake seasoning and serve with sauce.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And there you have it, a delicious, juicy aburi steak</p>
